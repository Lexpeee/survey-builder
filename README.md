# Proform - Survey Builder
A custom survey form builder in which you can create your own with customizable themes and formats. 

## Motivation behind this project
When I got my first job as a Web developer during the pandemic (May 2020), one of my first feature I've built was a custom survey builder form inspired by [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/), where you can create amazing forms that are way different than the usual norms like Google Forms, and other related programs. I fell in love with how you can add custom themes and colors to your forms, adding logic to some questions when a specific answer, keyword is set. I have dream't of making an app similar to it in my own way

## Things I've learned
- Sharpened more of my [react-hook-form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form) skills
- Using MongoDB as my primary database to store all my surveys, fields, and user-generated answers. 
- Storing user-configured themes to a survey, which is super-fun. 

## Things I'm planning to add
- Workspaces
- Separate modal for name of survey and survey type
- Additional results details (ave. time, submissions, started forms, devices list)
- Sharable via link or open form
- More input selections (address fields, email fields, date fields, dropdown, etc.)
- font selections for forms
- Question descriptions
- Value variables
- Two or more input boxes in a single page
